# ND1309 C2 Ethereum Smart Contracts, Tokens and Dapps - Project Starter 
**PROJECT: Decentralized Star Notary Service Project** - For this project, you will create a DApp by adding functionality with your smart contract and deploy it on the public testnet.

### ToDo
This Starter Code has already implemented the functionalities you implemented in the StarNotary (Version 2) exercise, and have comments in all the files you need to implement your tasks.

 ### Version
 * truffle : Truffle v5.11.5 (core: 5.11.5)
 * openzeppelin-solidity : ^2.4.0
 * Ganache : v7.9.1
 * Solidity : - 0.5.16 (solc-js)
 * Node : v20.9.0
 * Web3.js : v1.10.0

### Token
* ERC-721 Token Name : Haftasia
* ERC-721 Token Symbol : HFS


### Dependencies
For this project, you will need to have:
1. **Node and NPM** installed - NPM is distributed with [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
```bash
# Check Node version
node -v
# Check NPM version
npm -v
```


2. **Truffle v5.X.X** - A development framework for Ethereum. 


2. **Metamask: 5.3.1** - If you need to update Metamask just delete your Metamask extension and install it again.


3. [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) - Make sure that your Ganache and Truffle configuration file have the same port.


4. **Other mandatory packages**:
```bash

# install packages
npm install --save  openzeppelin-solidity
npm install --save  truffle-hdwallet-provider
npm install webpack-dev-server -g
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
npm install web3
```


### Run the application
1. Clean the frontend 
```bash
cd app
rm -rf node_modules
npm cache clean --force
rm package-lock.json
npm init -y
npm install
```


2. Start Truffle by running
```bash
# For starting the development console
truffle develop
# truffle console

# For compiling the contract, inside the development console, run:
compile

# For migrating the contract to the locally running Ethereum network, inside the development console
migrate --reset

# For running unit tests the contract, inside the development console, run:
test
```

3. Frontend - Once you are ready to start your frontend, run the following from the app folder:
```bash
cd app
npm run dev
```

---

### Important
When you will add a new Rinkeyby Test Network in your Metamask client, you will have to provide:

| Network Name | New RPC URL | Chain ID |
|---|---|---|
|Private Network 1|`http://127.0.0.1:9545/`|1337 |

The chain ID above can be fetched by:
```bash
cd app
node index.js
```

## Troubleshoot
#### Error 1 
```
'webpack-dev-server' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
**Solution:**
- Delete the node_modules folder, the one within the /app folder
- Execute `npm install` command from the /app folder

After a long install, everything will work just fine!


#### Error 2
```
ParserError: Source file requires different compiler version. 
Error: Truffle is currently using solc 0.5.16, but one or more of your contracts specify "pragma solidity >=0.X.X <0.X.X".
```
**Solution:** In such a case, ensure the following in `truffle-config.js`:
```js
// Configure your compilers  
compilers: {    
  solc: {      
    version: "0.5.16", // <- Use this        
    // docker: true,
    // ...
```
